# KARL-Fast-Kernel-Aggregation-Queries
Before you run or read our codes, please make sure you understand the concept of our paper and also read the supplementary notes (KARL_supplementary.pdf) in this github.

Please note that the folder "Publish_codes.zip" is not the library but it is only used for our testing in our publication. We are still developing/ integrating the codes to the KARL library. We will release the library soon, probably before the ICDE2019 presentation, 8th April,2019. We hope to integrate more machine learning models/ more kernel functions into this library.
